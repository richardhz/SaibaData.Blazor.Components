### SaibaData.Blazor.Components
This project represents research on how to create a themed Blazor component library.
I see this as a good way to get a better understanding of how Blazor works.

So far I have created;

- LanguageSwitcher which will store the currently selected language in local storage using jsInterop
- Collapsable Card 
- Svg Component to display svgs
- Collection extension methods to configure library
- AssemblyResourceLocator to locate resources such as Svgs distributed with the library

Todo;

- Default theme
